## Assignment 2 CS4241 by Austin Rebello
This project implemented the functionality of get and post requests to a node.js server. The get requests specifically gathered the required files as well as the server side array of objects to be displayed on the site. The post requests allow the user to add, delete or edit entries within the server side list. Flex boxes were used to space out the three forms within a horizontal manner on the site, with the table being displayed below the forms, having alternating row colors to increase table readability.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single Page App**: Through the use of fetching, I was able to post the data to the server, then immediately call it back down to the index page without having to refresh the page. The table will automatically update each time the data is changed (any time something is added, removed or edited). Once the data is pulled back down to the client, the client then rebuilds the table with the changes.
- **Modification Form**: A third form was added to my website that takes in all fields of a person (except derived). The user can then give the ID of the person they want to modify, and what they want to modify the values to, and the server will update those values if the ID is found. It is worth noting that nothing will happen if the ID entered does not match any ID existing in the table, and if fields are left blank, they are submitted as blank to the server. This behavior is intentional.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **User Think Aloud Study**: 
Last Name One:
What problems did the user have with your design?

What comments did they make that surprised you?

What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
